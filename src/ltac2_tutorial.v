(*** An Ltac2 tutorial *)

(* This tutorial aims to be pragmatic, but it is not specific to an application.
The pragmatics of Ltac2 are likely to change, as the language becomes more
usable. Picking an application and really trying to use Ltac2 for it is likely
to uncover more tricks and bug reports necessary to make the language work. *)

(* In addition, you should also go ahead and read the refman Ltac2 reference:
https://coq.github.io/doc/master/refman/proof-engine/ltac2.html. It's good to
just get a sense of the features and some of the terminology. However, it will
not teach you Ltac2, hence this guide. *)

(* The first thing to learn is how to import Ltac2. This was recently added to
the reference manual. *)
From Ltac2 Require Import Ltac2.
From Ltac2 Require Option.

(* The act of importing Ltac2 loads the plugin and makes Ltac2 the default
language for new proofs. *)

(******************************************************************************)
(* Ltac2 definitions are values, typically functions in the tactic monad that
produce values but potentially constants. Here's a function that's a bit like
Ltac1 [idtac] without the printing support, but note that it is explicitly
thunked.

This was the first example I wrote, but note that it isn't actually needed in
Ltac2 - you should just use () where you absolutely needed idtac in Ltac1 (eg,
in a match pattern that should do nothing). *)
Ltac2 idtac () := ().
(* here's what the above desugars to: *)
Ltac2 idtac' := fun p => match p with
                         | () => ()
                         end.

(******************************************************************************)
(*+ Hello world **)

(* We can print things in Ltac2, using tools from the Message library. *)

Ltac2 hello_world () := Message.print (Message.of_string "Hello, world!").

Goal True.
  hello_world ().
Abort.

(* We can also evaluate Ltac2 expressions: *)

Ltac2 Eval hello_world ().

(* We can also print constrs (terms): *)
Ltac2 Eval Message.print (Message.of_constr '(3+4)).

(******************************************************************************)
(*+ Reading the Ltac2 source *)

(* You will need to read the Ltac2 source
(https://github.com/coq/coq/tree/master/user-contrib/Ltac2) to figure out how
things work. This ranges from fine to totally impossible.

For example, let's figure out the Message API. We open
https://github.com/coq/coq/blob/master/user-contrib/Ltac2/Message.v and look at
what's there. It doesn't have a type [Message.t] but just [message], so find
its definition - it's defined as [Ltac2 Type message], which means it comes
from OCaml. That's fine, it's opaque anyway.

In Message.v we see one eliminator (print), a few constructors for Ltac2
primitives, and concatenation. This also tells us that there's no printf. *)

(******************************************************************************)
(*+ Variables *)

(* Ltac2 requires much more precise notation to access variables from
the various contexts - there are Ltac2 variables, Gallina references, and the
dynamic goal environment, for example. *)

(* These notations are generally instances of a more general antiquotation
feature for accessing various sub-languages, including for creating constrs,
idents, and patterns, for example. *)

(* There are four ways to reference a variable:
  - x refers to an Ltac2 variable as-is, within another Ltac2 expression.
  - @x is the same as ident:(x) - it produces an ident for "x"
  - &x is used to refer to a dynamic name. Think of it as x, but it resolves the
    name entirely dynamically. It has two definitions:
     - as an Ltac2 expression, it means [Control.hyp @x], referring to the
       name "x" in the dynamic environment. Note this isn't the same as
       Control.hyp x, which looks up an Ltac2 variable x of type ident.
     - in a constr, it expands to [ltac2:(Control.refine (fun () =>
       Control.hyp @x))]. This is more-or-less the same as the above, but has to
       escape to Ltac2 and back to actually do the lookup.
  - $x refers to an Ltac2 variable x of type constr within a constr:(...)
    antiquotation. It is equivalent to [ltac2:(Control.refine (fun () => x))].
    This is more necessary than it would seem since sometimes an Ltac2 notation
    accepts a constr, so inserting a variable requires this escape.

  I constantly get these mixed up.
 *)

(* referring to a constr variable: *)
Ltac2 bar () := let x := '(3+4) in constr:($x + 5).

Section with_x.
  Context (x:nat).
  (* referring to a hypothesis: *)
  Ltac2 foo () := constr:(3+&x).

  Definition global_x: nat := 3.
  Ltac2 use_global_x () := constr:(3 + global_x).
End with_x.

(* Where did all of this complexity come from? In Ltac1, it was actually worse -
there were dynamic heuristics to decide whether something was an Ltac1 variable
or a Gallina identifier, for example. *)

(****************************************************************************)
(* Here's an illustration of this: *)
Inductive boole := fact | lie.

(* this doesn't do what it looks like - the fact argument to exact is a constr,
and the boole constructor gets "internalized" (internalization is static
compilation, evaluation is dynamic), while the fact Ltac2-level argument is unused. *)
Ltac2 solve_with := fun fact => exact fact.
Print Ltac2 solve_with. (* note type is 'a -> unit *)

(* as another illustration of internalization, here's a function that will
create an ill-typed term, but the typechecking only happens at runtime: *)
Ltac2 ill_typed () := constr:(3+tt).
Fail Ltac2 Eval ill_typed ().

(* we need to use $ to refer to the fact argument *)
Ltac2 solve_with_correct := fun (fact:constr) => exact $fact.
Goal True.
  (* to pass [I] as a constr, we use ', which is a shorthand for the open_constr
  antiquotation (we could have written [constr:(I)], but that's longer). *)

Qed.

(* In Ltac1 you may get either the bound variable or the global reference. Here,
you get the variable: *)
Ltac solve_with := fun fact => exact fact.
Goal True.
  ltac1:(solve_with I).
Qed.

(* What if we wanted to refer to the global fact of type boole? This still
doesn't work (it still solves the goal using the argument): *)
Ltac solve_with_fact := fun fact => let x := constr:(fact) in exact x.
Goal boole.
  Fail ltac1:(solve_with_fact true).
Abort.

(*+ Calling Ltac2 from Ltac1 *)

(* The FFI to call into Ltac2 is to call an Ltac2 expression of type unit that
solves a goal. There is a mechanism to pass arguments, which are represented as
dynamically-typed values of type Ltac1.t (this is just the reverse of the
above). These can be run as tactics or converted to/from constrs and lists (note
that this means Ltac1 ints and strings cannot be used - this is probably just an
oversight in the API). *)

(******************************************************************************)
(*+ Exceptions *)

(* Ltac2 has good support for exceptions. The support is based on the [exn]
_open type_, which supports dynamic extension and thus eliminating exn always
requires a catch-all case. You can create your own open types in Ltac2, but
let's focus on this one. *)

Ltac2 Type exn ::= [ MyNewException(string) ].

which is unrecoverable *)

Goal True.
  Fail Control.throw (MyNewException ("oops")).
  (*  Uncaught Ltac2 exception: MyNewException ("oops") *)

(* Ltac2 also has first-class backtracking via exceptions *)

(* The next thing we can do is backtrack over an exception, producing effects
along the way: *)
Ltac2 Eval
  Control.plus
    (fun () => Message.print (Message.of_string "hello ");
    Control.zero (MyNewException "oops"))
    (fun e => Message.print (Message.of_exn e)).

(* Control.zero and Control.throw have the same type but very different
semantics: throw produces an uncatchable exception, whereas zero produces an
exception that supports backtracking with Contol.plus and catching with
Control.case *)

  Control.plus
    (fun () => Message.print (Message.of_string "hello ");
    Control.throw (MyNewException "oops"))
    (fun e => Message.print (Message.of_exn e)).

(* The refman explains backtracking as "viewing thunks as lazy lists", and then
the zero and plus operators are the empty list and concatenation operators, and
also these are a "monoid compatible with sequentialization". I don't really
understand this.

On the other hand, bhere's an example of a "backtracking string" and how you can
view it as a list of two strings: *)

Ltac2 x_or_y () := Control.plus (fun () => "x") (fun _ => "y").

Ltac2 get_x_and_y () :=
  match Control.case x_or_y with
  | Val xyf => let (x, yf) := xyf in
               (x, yf Not_found)
  | Err exn => Control.throw exn
end.

Ltac2 Eval get_x_and_y ().

(* I think this is really powerful? *)

(* One limitation I can see is that exceptions aren't typed: there's a single
dynamic type with all the exceptions, and all Ltac2 code is in a single effect,
one with exceptions and a proofview. *)

(******************************************************************************)
(*+ Reading the Ltac2 source, part 2 *)
(* Now let's try something harder. Let's solve
https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/11641 - namely, let's implement [Ltac2 change
(a:constr) (b:constr)]. Note that we will fail, in the end.

First let's figure out where [change] is exposed in Ltac2 - we expect to find a
primitive Ltac2 tactic and an Ltac2 notation. The notation is in [Notations.v],
and it ultimately calls [Std.change].

Here's the definition of change (for its type signature):

[Ltac2 @ external change : pattern option -> (constr array -> constr) -> clause
-> unit := "ltac2" "tac_change".]

This takes a pattern option for the thing to change, a (constr array -> constr)
for the right-hand side (the argument is stuff bound by the pattern), and an
occurrence clause for where to apply the change (a subset of the goals and
hypotheses). *)

(* First-class occurrence clauses are really nice in Ltac2, but only
if you use the tactics and not the notations. Anyway for now we're going to
ignore the clause and just set it to the goal. (we can look at the definition of
clause to see how to write that) *)
Ltac2 goal_clause := {Std.on_hyps := None; Std.on_concl := Std.AllOccurrences}.

(* First, the pattern stuff. First we learn that [change] actually takes
patterns as arguments: *)
Goal 2 + 3 = 5.
Proof.
  change (?x + ?y) with ($y + $x).
  (* in Ltac1 we don't antiquote to refer to bound variables, they're resolved
  dynamically *)
  ltac1:(change (?x + ?y) with (y + x)).
Abort.

(* Now that we're edified we want to forget about patterns and just pass a
constr, and ignore the [constr array] argument for the right-hand side of the
change. This is the hard part. *)

(* We learn from @ppedrot's answer that pattern:(...) is the right way to
construct a pattern... but there the only way to convert a constr to a pattern
is the OCaml pattern_of_constr function, which is "broken" and thus will not be
exposed to Ltac2. *)

(* The astute reader will observe that we are stuck at this point. It's still
possible to pass the constr to Ltac1 and do the change that way (using
[pattern_of_constr] implicitly), but there's no pure Ltac2 solution.

Instead, we really need to open an issue asking for a variant of [change] that
operates on constrs rather than patterns (@ppedrot calls this a variant of [set]
that does a conversion rather than posing a variable, but that explanation seems
convoluted to me). *)

(****************************************************************************)
(*+ Pretyping *)

(* note: this section is an obscure and potentially useless feature, just for
fun *)

(* When you use an ltac2-in-term for a notation (note: this is my made-up
terminology, the refman roughly says "when an Ltac2 antiquotation appears inside
a Coq term notation"), then notation variables are bound to Ltac2 variables of
type preterm. Basically you have to pretype them into constrs, but we can modify
the environment before doing so: *)

(* this the identity, where we just pretype the input and return it (by
solving the antiquotation goal) *)
Notation fancy_identity x := ltac2:(let x := Constr.pretype x in exact $x) (only parsing).
(* Now we're going to do something crazy: pretype the preterm with y bound: *)

           (fun _ =>
              constr:(fun (y:nat) =>
                        ltac2:(Control.refine
                                 (fun _ => Constr.pretype x))))) (only parsing).
(* sadly this doesn't work *)
Fail Definition foo := with_y y.

(* ...but this does *)

  := eq_refl.
